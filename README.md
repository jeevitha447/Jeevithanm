# JeevithanmSpeech recognition is a technology that converts spoken words into text, enabling computers to understand and process human speech. Here's an overview of its key components and functionality:

How Speech Recognition Works
1. *Speech Input*: Audio signals are captured and analyzed.
2. *Feature Extraction*: The audio signals are broken down into smaller parts, and features like pitch, tone, and volume are extracted.
3. *Acoustic Modeling*: Mathematical representations of speech sounds are created to distinguish between words.
4. *Decoder*: Algorithms interpret the audio signals and generate text output.

Key Features of Effective Speech Recognition
- *AI and Machine Learning*: Advanced solutions use AI and ML to improve accuracy and adapt to different accents and speaking styles.
- *Grammar and Syntax*: Understanding the structure and composition of language to improve recognition accuracy.
- *Speaker Diarization*: Identifying and segmenting speech by speaker identity ¹.

Applications of Speech Recognition
- *Virtual Assistants*: Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, and Bixby.
- *Text-to-Speech*: Reading aloud text on screens, supporting multiple languages.
- *Transcription*: Converting spoken words into written text for various industries.

Evaluation Metrics
- *Word Error Rate (WER)*: Measures accuracy by calculating the number of errors in the recognized text.
- *Single Word Error Rate (SWER)*: Evaluates accuracy at the individual word level.
- *Command Success Rate (CSR)*: Measures the success rate of speech recognition in executing commands ².
